# CS-319-UI-UX-Design
1) What the projects do?

Both of these projects were assignment to me to teach me how to design UI/UX wireframe prototypes for the design of applications for different devices.  I learned a lot about using Lucid Chart to create these different wireframes.  I also learned the many different techniques that UI/UX designers use in order to make sure that communication and information between all involved parties are documented and factored into the start or creation of the project.

2) How are these projects useful?

These projects can be used as a base for future wireframes and as an example of part of my knowledge on the creation of wireframes.
