## 🧠 About This Project

The goal of this course project was to apply core UX/UI principles to real or hypothetical design challenges by:

- Conducting **user research** and developing user personas  
- Creating **wireframes** and low-fidelity sketches  
- Building **interactive prototypes**  
- Applying **visual design principles** (layout, typography, color, accessibility)  
- Documenting **design rationale and usability findings**

Whether you’re evaluating user flows, UI patterns, or visual hierarchy, this repository highlights thoughtful design decisions at every stage.
